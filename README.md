The query tool is a React application, developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using a variety of tools including [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), and [MUI](https://mui.com/).

Please refer to our [**official documentation**](https://neurobagel.org/query_tool/) for more detailed information on how to use the query tool.

## Quickstart

The query tool is hosted at https://query.neurobagel.org/ and interfaces with [Neurobagel federation API](https://federate.neurobagel.org/docs).

## Local Installation

To run the query tool locally, you have two options:

1. Use our docker image
2. Do a manual install from the cloned git repo.

but before proceeding with either you need to set the environment variables.

### Mandatory configuration

| Environment variable   | Type    | Required                                 | Default value if not set | Example                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NB_API_QUERY_URL`     | string  | Yes                                      | -                        | `https://federate.neurobagel.org/`                        |
| `NB_IS_FEDERATION_API` | boolean | No                                       | `true`                   | `true`                                                    |
| `NB_QUERY_URL_PATH`    | string  | No                                       | `/`                      | `/query/`                                                 |
| `NB_ENABLE_AUTH`       | boolean | No                                       | `false`                  | `false`                                                   |
| `NB_QUERY_CLIENT_ID`   | string  | Yes (if `NB_ENABLE_AUTH` is set to true) | -                        | `46923719231972-dhsahgasl3123.apps.googleusercontent.com` |

#### `NB_API_QUERY_URL`

You'll need to set the `NB_API_QUERY_URL` environment variable required to run the query tool. `NB_API_QUERY_URL` is the [Neurobagel API](https://github.com/neurobagel/api) URL that the query tool uses to send requests to for results.

#### `NB_IS_FEDERATION_API`

If the API you'd like to send queries to is not a [federation api](https://neurobagel.org/federate/), you need to set the `NB_IS_FEDERATION_API` to `false` as it is `true` by default.

#### `NB_QUERY_URL_PATH`

If you are using a custom configuration where the query tool is accessible via a path other than the root (`/`), you need to set the `NB_QUERY_URL_PATH` to your custom path. This ensures that the query tool is correctly rendered and accessible at the specified URL

#### `NB_ENABLE_AUTH`

If the API you'd like to send queries to requires authentication, you need to set `NB_ENABLE_AUTH` to `true` as it is `false` by default. This will enable authentication flow of the app.

#### `NB_QUERY_CLIENT_ID`

If the `NB_ENABLE_AUTH` is set to `true` (it is `false` by default), you need to provide a valid client ID for the authentication.
_At the moment, query tool uses Google for authentication, so you need to obtain a client ID from Google developer console. See [documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid) for more information._

#### Set the environment variables

To set environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the environment variables there. If you're running a neurobagel node-API locally on your machine (following the instructions [here](https://github.com/neurobagel/api#local-installation)), your `.env` file would look something like this:

```bash
NB_API_QUERY_URL=http://localhost:8000/
NB_IS_FEDERATION_API=false # For node API
```

if you're using the remote (in this example federation) api, your `.env` file would look something like this:

```bash
NB_API_QUERY_URL=https://federate.neurobagel.org/
```

if you're using a federation api with authentication, your `.env` file would look something like this:

```bash
NB_API_QUERY_URL=https://federate.neurobagel.org/
NB_ENABLE_AUTH=true
NB_QUERY_CLIENT_ID=46923719231972-dhsahgasl3123.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

:warning: The protocol matters here.
If you wish to use the Neurobagel remote API, ensure your `NB_API_QUERY_URL` uses `https` instead of `http`.

### Docker installation

To obtain the query tool docker image, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker pull neurobagel/query_tool:latest
```

This Docker image includes the latest release of the query tool and a minimal http server to serve the static tool.

To launch the query tool Docker container and pass in the `.env` file you have created, simply run

```bash
docker run -p 5173:5173 --env-file=.env neurobagel/query_tool:latest
```

Then you can access the query tool at http://localhost:5173

**Note**: the query tool is listening on port `5173` inside the docker container,
replace port `5173` by the port you would like to expose to the host.
For example if you'd like to run the tool on port `8000` of your machine you can run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:5173 --env-file=.env neurobagel/query_tool:latest
```

### Manual installation

To install the query tool directly, you'll need [node package manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
You can find the instructions on installing npm and node in the official [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once you have npm and node installed, you'll need to install the dependencies outlined in the package.json file.
You can do so by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

To launch the tool in developer mode run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can also build and then run the tool from ([production](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build)) build of the application by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview
```

You can verify the tool is running by watching for the` info messages from Vite regarding environment, rendering, and what port the tool is running on in your terminal.

#### Developer setup

Having installed the dependencies, run the following command to enable husky `pre-commit` and `post-merge` hooks:

```
npx husky install
```

## Usage

To define a cohort, set your inclusion criteria using the following:

- Age: Minimum and/or maximum age (in years) of participant that should be included in the results.
- Sex: Sex of participant that should be included in the results.
- Diagnosis: Diagnosis of participant that should be included in the results
- Healthy control: Whether healthy participants should be included in the results. Once healthy control checkbox is selected, diagnosis field will be disabled since a participant cannot be both a healthy control and have a diagnosis.
- Minimum number of sessions: Minimum number of imaging sessions that participant should have to be included in the results.
- Assessment tool: Non-imaging assessment completed by participant that should be included in the results.
- Modality: Imaging modality of participant scans that should be included in the results.

Once you've defined your criteria, submit them as a query and the query tool will display the results.\
The query tool offers two different TSV files for results:

- Dataset-level results TSV contains: dataset id, dataset name, dataset portal uri, number of matching subjects, and available imaging modalities
- Participant-level results TSV contains: dataset id, subject id, age, sex, diagnosis, assessment, session id, session file path, number of sessions, and imaging modality

The output files can be joined using `DatasetID` as key.

You can refer to [the neurobagel documentation](https://neurobagel.org/query_tool/#downloading-query-results) to see what the outputs of the query tool look like and how they are structured. You can also download the raw example output files [here](https://github.com/neurobagel/neurobagel_examples/tree/main/query-tool-results).

## Testing

The query tool utilizes [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) framework for testing.

To run the tests execute the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

## License

The query tool is released under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE)
